			Android Attendance Application
Goal: To create a mobile application that will scan ID cards for attendance and maintain one trimester attendance for all faculty members classes.


Team:
Software Developer: Colin
Software Developer: Joe
Github Scrum Master: Mark
Research/ Documentation: Victor


Criteria:
Android Application for Phone
Hardware to scan ID 
Present/ Absent/ Tardy options when signing in


Constraints:
Access to Johnson & Wales student records Database
How to scan the users ID?
Hardware  - To scan the ID card
Time - How long do you have to finish the program (6 weeks)
Schedule - How often you work on the program day to day (EX: Class time or Personal time)
Programing language ex: (Github Scrum) - “Somebody has to learn Scrum” Scrum 101 Videos
Use of specific library scripts or frameworks
Team composition and makeup - Do you need a specialist to be on the team(Specific individuals, perhaps for training purposes)
Lack of accountability
Groups need platform for development
Team Burn out over the course of the project(Velocity)
Missing Student ID’s
Cost of project


Desirables: 
Ex: “ It would be nice to have ”
If the program runs
Break down certain task into sections (Divide and conquer method)
Reach our deadlines on time
Control cost depending on the amount spent(Is the software your using free or do you pay)
Clean code making sure that the code does not have any bugs in it. Which can slow the attendance sign in process down.
Quality management How well the program performs. 
Constant communication and feedback
Stay on task- some workers will check their emails, social media, or just not focus when it's time to work.
No scope changes - Making sure that the client does not want to make any last second changes after you begin to code


Ex “Project must have”
A fully design and known goal
Must be able to scan a students ID and place it in a database.
Must work on an android application

Data Gathering - Things you don't know yet 
How long is it going to take to enter a Student into attendance system
How effective is mobile scanner(The ease of time to scan the ID)
